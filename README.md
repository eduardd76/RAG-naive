# RAG-naive

Networking RAG Projects

This repository contains three implementations of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for Networking, each offering different levels of sophistication in handling network related aspects.

Naive RAG â€“ A simple retrieval-based approach using traditional methods. Advanced RAG (Raptor-based) â€“ An optimized RAG pipeline leveraging Raptor for high-performance retrieval. AI-Based RAG â€“ A fully autonomous agent-driven RAG system that dynamically adapts to network issues.

These projects aim to assist network engineers, architects, and operations teams by improving how they access, retrieve, and utilize networking knowledge.

1. Naive RAG for Networking

Overview The naive RAG implementation provides a basic retrieval mechanism for networking data. It uses BM25, TF-IDF, or FAISS-based retrieval combined with a language model (GPT, Llama) to provide relevant responses based on network configurations, RFCs, and vendor documentation.
